# Eigen Explorer Node / Server Backend

This is the node/server backend for [Eigen Explorer](https://eigenexplorer.com). Eigen Explorer backend provides an array of API endpoints organized around REST for community users and developers to quickly access data and information about the Eigen Layer ecosystem.

Our API features predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and adheres to standard HTTP response codes, authentication methods, and verbs.

Currently, the API is free to use and open to the public. Please note that the API is currently in Beta and may be subject to change.
